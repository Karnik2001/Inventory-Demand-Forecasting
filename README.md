# Inventory Demand Forecasting

The project provides a comprehensive application of machine learning and time series models to forecast inventory demand with the goal of improving inventory management practices. The key takeaways and findings are as follows:

## 1. Objective and Impact

The primary aim of the analysis was to:

    Improve forecast accuracy of product demand.

    Minimize inventory holding costs and stockouts.

    Enable data-driven decisions in supply chain and procurement operations.

Accurate demand forecasting is essential to avoid excess inventory (which ties up capital) and stockouts (which lead to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction).

## 2. Methodologies Applied

The analysis tested multiple models for demand forecasting, including:

    Linear Regression: Used as a baseline model to identify relationships between demand and explanatory variables such as time and promotions.

    ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A time-series model that captures trend and seasonality for univariate forecasting.

    Random Forest: An ensemble machine learning model that handles multivariate input and captures nonlinear relationships.

Each model was trained and validated using historical sales data, with performance assessed based on metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

## 3. Key Findings

    Random Forest outperformed other models in terms of prediction accuracy due to its ability to model complex interactions between variables.

    Seasonality and trend components were critical in improving model performance, particularly for ARIMA.

    Incorporating external features (e.g., promotions, weather, holidays) further enhanced prediction quality in machine learning models.

    Data preprocessing such as missing value imputation, feature engineering, and normalization was crucial for ensuring accurate outputs.

## 4. Business Implications

    The insights from forecasting models enable just-in-time inventory management, reducing warehousing costs.

    Improved accuracy translates to better customer service levels and higher sales conversion rates.

    The analysis recommends that companies adopt ensemble models like Random Forest for daily to weekly demand forecasting while leveraging time-series models for long-term planning.

## 5. Limitations and Future Work

    The models depend heavily on data quality and granularity; more detailed SKU-level data could improve forecasts.

    Future work may involve deploying deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) or integrating real-time inventory data for dynamic forecasting.

    Incorporating supply-side constraints like lead time variability and vendor reliability could enhance practical decision-making.

## Final Conclusion

The study validates the effectiveness of machine learning and time series models in forecasting inventory demand. The findings suggest that businesses can significantly improve inventory control and supply chain responsiveness by integrating advanced forecasting tools. Random Forest emerged as the most robust model, offering actionable insights for procurement and inventory teams.
